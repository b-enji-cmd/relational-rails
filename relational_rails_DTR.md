#### Project Expectations:

  * Mindful of shared file or structure, like Welcome page. Do not make change until partner agrees.
  * Each of us should be able to explain our app when asked and the design structure we've chosen.
  * Even though we are coding in parallel we need to help one another understand the code each has created.

### How to overcome obstacles:
  * Ask for help - no longer than one Pom, if we are struggling for more than one its a good indicator to reach out for help.
  * Communicate with each other if we run into differences with approach about the project, schedule, or anything else that may arise.

### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
  * Ben
    * Mentor meeting - Tue 4:30-5:30, Thur 5-6
  * Genevieve
    * Mentor meeting - Tue 5-6
  * Sunday - NO WORK

### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
  * When we need to work together just slack each other. Expectation is to respond within the hour. Worse case text if necessary.
  * Communicate early and often, especially if you need help.

### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

  * Parallel mostly, additional workload will be split up when we begin tackling ActiveRecord and Usability.

### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):

  * Ideally, don't merge your own pull requests. Project partner should merge. If your project partner is unavailable and there is a time constraint, then merge on own.
  * Tuple for paired programming and calls.
  * Slack for general communication and when a PR has been opened
